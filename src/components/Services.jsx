 school or daycare – wherever it’s most
  convenient and comfortable.

     <p className="text-center font-arimo text-[20px] sm:mx-16">If you or someone you know struggles with their
      mental health, it may be time to consider treatment
       options. For many people, the word “treatment”
       conjures up images of locked facilities where visiting
        hours are strictly regulated. While this type of
         treatment does exist and can be very helpful, a 
         less-restrictive therapeutic environment can be
          helpful as well. Outpatient mental health programs
           offer the same quality of treatment as inpatient 
           programs but with more freedom and flexibility.
